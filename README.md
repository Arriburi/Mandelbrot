# Mandelbrot

A Mandelbrot set is a set of points from a set complex numbers. By drawing
the points we obtain infinite fractals that form interesting eye catching images. The usual implementation is based on the visualization. To graphically
represent a Mandelbrot set im using the escape-time algorithm that computes the
color of a pixel and draws it.
